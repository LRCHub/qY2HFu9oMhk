Take my hand,
Hurray for the winters come...
Cease my plans
Excuse me from the scenes of old

I can meet you there?
I just don't care
On this new year's day
With no celebration from me

Understand
There's comfort with the wealth of gold
Increase demands
Release me from the scenes of old

I can't make it clear
You just won't hear
On this new years day
There's no celebration
There's no celebration from me

I could see you there?
We just don't care
On this new years day
Without hesitation
There's no celebration from me
